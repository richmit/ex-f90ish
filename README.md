These small programs illustrate some of features in "modern" Fortran
(that is, fortran 90 and later) from the perspective of a FORTRAN 77
programmer.

Note the simple makefile works well for gfortran & LLVM flang on both
Linux & Windows MSYS2; however, the intel support is unlikely to work
for anyone but me.

You can read a bit more about these examples on 
my [home page](https://www.mitchr.me/SS/exampleCode/Fortran.html).

Have fun!
