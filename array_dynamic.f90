!  Assumed arrays, demonstrated in SWAP1, are nice if they are small enough to fit on the stack.  For larger arrays, demonstrated
!  in SWAP2, ALLOCATE is the way to go.  SWAP3 demonstrates something similar using POINTERs; however, this technique isn't as
!  recommended as it's a bit more error prone.
!  
!  These swap subroutines are quite wasteful in terms of RAM.  See array_elemental.f90 for a better implementation.
