program loop_do

  implicit none
  integer :: i, j
  
  ! end do is finally part of the language.  i MUST be an integer.
  print *, 'Example Loop 1'
  do i=1,20,2
     print *, '  PRE-CYCLE: ', i
     if( (i .gt. 2) .and. (i .lt. 12) ) then
        cycle
     end if
     print *, ' POST-CYCLE: ', i
     if(i .gt. 14) then
        exit
     end if
  end do

  ! Loops can have names, and cycle/exit can use them
  print *, 'Example Loop 2'
  out_loop: do i=1,3
     in_loop: do j=1,3
        print *, '  PRE-CYCLE: ', i, j
        if(i .eq. 2) then
           cycle out_loop
        end if
     print *, ' POST-CYCLE: ', i, j
  end do in_loop
  end do out_loop

  ! Do WHILE, and end do are in the standard too! Like regular do loops, they can have names too.
  print *, 'Example Loop 3'
  i=0
  while_loop: do while (i .lt. 5)
     i=i+1
     if(i .eq. 3) then
        cycle
     end if
     print *, ' i=', i
  end do while_loop

  ! Infinite loops are easy too:
  print *, 'example loop 3'
  i=0
  do
     i=i+1
     if(i .eq. 3) then
        exit
     end if
     print *, ' i=', i
  end do

end program loop_do
