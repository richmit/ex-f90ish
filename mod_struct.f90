module mod_struct
  implicit none  
  private                        ! IMO most every module should be private, and explicit about what is shared

  integer, public  :: modint = 5 ! Add PUBLIC We want to export modint
  integer, private :: i      = 6 ! PRIVATE is the default, but I like to include it.
                                 ! This I variable will not collide with I in the main program because it is privite

  public  :: hi_ma               ! We include this to "export" the subroutine

contains

  subroutine hi_ma(an_int)
    integer, intent(in)  :: an_int
    print *, 'hello ma! ', i, an_int
  end subroutine hi_ma

end module mod_struct
